### Description

Despeckler by Robert Rayment.(Update Re-load added) This attempts to demonstrate some basic patching, dust & scratch removal, de-spotting, pixel painting, sharp, soft, dark & brightening for pictures. The operations can be for the whole picture or a selected area with varying blemish sizes and thresholds. Color selection and a magnifier help with correcting small areas. Example bitmaps are included. Can be run as VB or VB+ASM. The ASM makes extensive use of MMX. 

----

Optionally the use of i_view32.exe (freeware from www.irfanview.com) is demonstrated for loading and saving any image file format in VB....See Notes.txt. 

----

Thanks to VBAccelerator.com (Dialog class), VBSpeed (Timer class) and Ulli (ToolTips class - PSC CodeId=42051) (Exe tested on WinXP) Win98, Zip 205KB.
