  Basic Despeckler by  Robert Rayment  
                 Jan/Feb 2003  V1.0

  Despeckling can never be completely
  automatic.  Trial and error, varying
  clump and threshold sizes is necessary.
  When despeckling is done patches can
  be moved from Picture 1 to Picture 2.
  Also individual pixels or a group of
  4 pixels can be painted on to Picture 2.

  The despeckling operations as well as the
  filters, can be applied over the whole
  picture or over a selected area using the
  shape tool.  

  NOTE that the despeckler and filters work
  on Picture 1 giving a result on Picture 2.
  So, to cascade operations copy Picture 2 
  to Picture 1.

  Hopefully most of the operations should
  be self-evident, thanks to Ulli's class
  for ToolTipTexts.  

  It is useful to have the magnifier on for
  painting pixels and de-spotting.  Note that
  the magnifier can be moved by the mouse.

  Pictures are loaded into Picture 1 and
  saved from Picture 2.

  Downloading i_view32.exe and placing it
  in the application folder allows other
  than standard VB file formats to be
  loaded and saved:-
  
  for loading & saving non-standard VB
  pictures use FREEWARE i_view32.exe
